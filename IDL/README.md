# IDL scripts and tricks

Here are some actual scripts I used to produce publication ready pictures. The programs are written
in [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), however the concept can be used
in other similar programming languages to construct the final result.

The resulting pictures are presented in the same directory.

> Note: The final images are later overlayed in the Apple KeyNote which gives an opportunity
> to annotate and then export it as vector graphics.
