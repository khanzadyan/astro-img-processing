# IDL scripts and tricks

Here are some actual scripts I used to produce publication ready pictures for article entitled 
[**GM 2-4: a signpost for low- and intermediate-mass star formation**](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/418/3/1994/1065798), Khanzadyan. et.al. 2011, MNRAS, 418,3. 

The programs are written in [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), 
however the concept can be used in other similar programming languages to construct the final result.

The resulting pictures are presented in the same directory.

> Note: The final images are later overlayed in the Apple KeyNote which gives an opportunity
> to annotate and then export it as vector graphics.
