# Creating publication ready pictures

Scripts and programs I used to create publication ready images while actively working
in Astronomy. These are scripts which I used to make my pictures that time.

Most of these scripts and programms are created over 10 years ago. There are much better
and simpler solutions out there. It is not the intention of this repository to provide
the most up-to-date guides for producing the publication ready pictures.

Everything provided here can be copied and used. I didn't invent everything from scratch, I
also found some solutions in some sources.

## Using IDL

There was a time when IDL or [Interactive Data Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language))
was used quite widely in the institutions where I worked. I've picked up some tips and examples from
various sources like [Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming](http://www.idlcoyote.com/) and some others.

Just check the IDL subdirectory to find these scripts.
