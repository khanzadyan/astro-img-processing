# Creating publication ready pictures

Scripts and programs I used to create publication ready images while actively working
in Astronomy. These are scripts which I used to make my pictures that time.

Most of these scripts and programms are created over 10 years ago. There are much better
and simpler solutions out there. It is not the intention of this repository to provide
the most up-to-date guides for producing the publication ready pictures.
